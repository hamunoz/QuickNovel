Essentially i've changed some things to make quicknovel more usable for myself and changed up the theming a little.

Main stuff is
- Extra trash category
- Added Unread only and Completed novels only toggles to sort menu
- Added sort by unread chapters this includes unread chapter count badges in library
- You can pull down in category to refresh data for novels in that category (unread counts, cover images, etc)
- Novel info page now has better download info and can be used offline without having to rely on the Downloads category/section
- Better caching and loading behaviour (faster)
